#nEnCapsulation : In normal terms Encapsulation
 is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit.
In C++ encapsulation can be implemented using Class and access modifiers

# Polymorphism: This actually means "One interface and multiple Methods". In fact 
the word polymorphism means many forms. A real life example would be a man can have 
several characters like he might be father,child, uncle and assassin at the same 
time. 
# C++ polymorphism is divided into 2 types:
	Compile time polymorphism
	-> Function overloading 
	-> Operator overloading 
	Runtime Polymorphism
	-> Virtual Functions(Function Overriding)
	Function overriding on the other hand occurs when a derived class has a definition
	for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to
	 be overridden.
