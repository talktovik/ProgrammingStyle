What actually important for recursion.
# tracing recursion 
# Stack used in recursion 
# Recurrence Relation
___________________________________

Why recursion is more powerful than normal loops because a recursion have 2 phases(assending and decending phase.)

lets see this snippit !

1 void fun(int n){
2 if(n > 0){
3 print('something');
4 fun(n-1)
5 print(somethinh here! )
}
}
so here line no 3 will execute before next recursion call. and 5 will happen when the control return to this function. and if on line 
number 4 we had something like a = fun(n-1) *2 then it would be executed at returning means when the return control would come then 
it would return.
