1. avoid use float or double in a Conditional statement,because it actually take more time than 
normal.

2. Using Ternery operator will actually reduce lines of code.

3. The statement like x = (y = 4 , y = y +1 ); is using comma operator.
at end x will get the same value as y+1.

4. Using Ternary operator like a pro bool ? function1() : function2(); 

5. [The Power of comma operator and for loop] by the help of comma operator 
 we can actually initialize more than one variables in the for loop and set 
appropriate conditions to check like: for( x=0, y= 0 , x+y <100 , x = x+1)

6. A very cool String Manupulation Example from the book.

Void function (char * targ, char* src) {
int i, j;
printf("%s\n", targ);

for(i =0 , j = strlen(src); i <= j; i++ ,j++){

targ[i] = src [i];
targ[j] = src [j];

printf("%s\n",targ);

}

7.This Code is mostly we can use while giving our user 3 chances to get the password right ;


void sign_in(void){
char str[20] = "";
int x ;

for(x = 0; x <3 && strcmp(str, "password"); x++){
printf("enter your password:");
gets(str);

}


gets() === Reads characters from the standard input (stdin) and stores them as a C string 
into str until a newline character or the end-of-file is reached.

8. for( ; ; ) This is a infinite loop.

9. Loops with No bodies = for( ; str* == " "; str++) ; this is a no body loop thus it have 
the value in certain algorithms.
Time delay loops are often used in programs. These are loops that have no other function than to kill time. 
Delay loops can be created by specifying an empty target statement.


10. The Historic Do while loop. 
SYNTAX :
  do {
 statement; 
} while (consition);

11. Error making thing, A variable initialized inside statement of loop would be local to that loop.


12. The Jump statements {continue, break, return ,goto}

13. The function kbhit() returns zero if non of the key is hit. found in "conio.h"
